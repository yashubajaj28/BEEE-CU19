EXP_3_Door_bell_using_push_button

THEORY: 
Push buttons or switches connect two points in a circuit when you press them. This example turns on one led when the button pressed once,
and off when pressed twice.
As per the circuit diagram, When the pushbutton is open (unpressed) there is no connection between the two legs of the pushbutton,
so the pin is connected to ground (through the pull-down resistor) and we read a LOW. When the button is closed (pressed),
it makes a connection between its two legs, connecting the pin to 5 volts, so that we read a HIGH.

LEARNING AND OBSERVATIONS:
As per the Arduino code, When the pushbutton is unpressed there is no connection between the two legs of the pushbutton,
so the pin is connected to ground (through the pull-down resistor) and we read a LOW. When the button is pressed,
it makes a connection between its two legs, connecting the pin to 5 volts, so that we read a HIGH.


PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING: 
You should take care whether the board in the arduino\uno or not and also selection of port in tools. This is the main problem where we
get confusion 

PRECAUTIONS: 
While installing led’s in bread board we should take care whether the ’n’ terminals of Buzzer is connected or not.Here the ‘n’ terminals 
should be connected similarly, we should check whether the ‘p’ terminals are connected or not.In this case ‘p’ terminals should not be
connected . 
Install the wires properly in both bread board and arduino board.  

LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
Door bell using push button was verified after uploading the program.
